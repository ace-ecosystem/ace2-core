# Alerting

An **alert** is created when a root is found to contain one or more [detection points](../design/detection_points.md) when processing analysis requests. 

Alerts are tracked through the [`ace.system.alerting.AlertTrackingInterface`](https://github.com/ace-ecosystem/ace2-core/blob/main/ace/system/alerting.py).
