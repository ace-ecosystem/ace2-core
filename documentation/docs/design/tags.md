# Tags

Tagging is a way to add additional information or context to analysis data. **Tags** can also be used to add relationships between different [root analysis](root_analysis.md) objects.

Only [observables](observable.md) and [analysis](analysis.md) can be tagged. In practice, observables are usually what get tagged.

Tagging shows up in the GUI as labels of varying colors.

The value of a tag is any UTF8 encoded string.
