#
# ACE Distributed Locking System
#
# This supports any number of locks that can be locked by any number of concurrent processes.
# Two processes can request the same lock at the same time, one will get it and proceed while the other blocks.
# If a request to acquire a lock would cause a dead lock condition then an exception in thrown instead.
# The call to acquire a lock can include an optional timeout which controls how long to wait for the lock.
# The call can also include an optional lock_timeout which controls how long the lock should be held until
# it expires automatically. Locks that expire are automatically released.
#
# A lock is identified by any unique string. A lock is created the first time it is requested. Locks that are
# no longer referenced are removed.
#
# When a lock is acquired it is assigned an "owner" which is any unique string. This is used to keep track of
# what owns what lock and what is waiting on what lock for the purpose of deadlock prevention.
#
